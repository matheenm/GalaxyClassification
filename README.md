# Convolution Neural Network to classify galaxies based on their shape

## The Galaxy Zoo Project
 Decision tree of classifications (Willett et al. 2013)

## Dataset
I used the dataset from  Galaxy Zoo - The Galaxy Challenge on [kaggle.com](www.kaggle.com):

The code uses the **images_training_rev1.zip** which has the images and **training_solutions_rev1.zip** which has the labelled soultions.
