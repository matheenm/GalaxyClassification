# Convolution Neural Network to classify galaxies based on their shape

## The Galaxy Zoo Project
 Decision tree of classifications (Willett et al. 2013)

## Dataset
I used the dataset from  Galaxy Zoo - The Galaxy Challenge on [kaggle.com](www.kaggle.com):

*kaggle competitions download galaxy-zoo-the-galaxy-challenge*

The code uses the **images_training_rev1.zip** which has the images and **training_solutions_rev1.zip** which has the labelled soultions.

## Convolution Neural Network

## Code

The code is broken down into two parts. The preprocessing which crops the images into a region of interest and generates 64x64 images. 
The second part trains the neural network.
